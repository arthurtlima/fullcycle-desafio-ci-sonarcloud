## üíª About the project

<p>In this challenge, we will be consolidating our knowledge regarding the creation of a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, incorporating SonarCloud for enhanced code quality analysis. Follow the steps outlined below:</p>

### Create a Simple Node.js Application:

- Develop a small and straightforward Node.js application (any type of application will suffice).

### Unit Testing:

- Develop unit tests for the created application to ensure its functionality and reliability.
Set Up CI Pipeline using GitHub Actions:

### Establish a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions that encompasses the following tasks:
- Install the application.
- Execute the unit tests.
- Perform SonarCloud analysis for code quality.

### GitHub Repository Configuration:

- Upload the application to a public repository on GitHub.
- Enable the status check, ensuring that a merge is only allowed if the application successfully passes through the CI pipeline and meets the quality gate standards set by SonarCloud.

### Create a Pull Request (PR):

- Initiate a Pull Request (PR) that encompasses the entire process.

### Provide PR Link for Review:

- Share the link to the Pull Request below for the purpose of review and feedback.
